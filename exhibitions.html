These galleries must keep deeply meaningful connections with their artists and follow them throughout their careers.

She developed her paintings with both agency and chance, choosing her palette from a catalogue of Japanese color combinations and employing knives, spatulas, paper towels and large paint brushes.</p></div>

VELLIQUETTE’s sculptural cut paper constructions insist on a new spiritual vocabulary, combining aspects of early 20th century formalism and contemporary sensibilities about the handmade with the visual lexicon he has developed over the past decade.  VELLIQUETTE’s vocabulary is bright, dense and ornamental, punctuated with recurring motifs such as hands, eyes, flowers, planets, mandalas and goofy, smiley faces.</p></div>

The work is comprised of three seamlessly looped HD video channels, each with 5.1 surround sound that combine to create a 15.3 surround sound experience. Azzarella suspends the iconic scenes, merging them with newly captured footage to create a naturalistic environment. In this fusion, tropical pools ripple and vines sway in anticipation of the thunderous entry of the protagonist, but instead the viewer is held transfixed in a moment.

<p>The inspirations for TOMPKINS’s paintings stem from his engagement with the tropes and language of the medium’s history. <span class="caps">TOMPKINS</span> begins his process of digitally altering found photographs by breaking the images down to core colors and by effect blurring the contours. He then uses high-gloss commercial enamel to execute the paintings on aluminum panels. The paintings, when viewed from a distance, reflect both physically and metaphorically a relational narrative which, upon closer inspection, dissolves into form and color. The artist communicates a sense of removal from the present and a conceptual representation of social, cultural, and personal &quot;memory.”</p></div>
