      <title>Sophie Crumb &amp; Aline Kominsky-Crumb</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;September  7 - October 19, 2014&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Opens Sunday, September  7  5:00 PM -  8:00 PM&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.dcktcontemporary.com/exhibitions/1547"&gt;&lt;img alt="Cekbroklxoki7xajfbut" src="http://a4.res.cloudinary.com/tristanmedia/image/private/c_limit,fl_keep_iptc,h_600,q_100,w_600/v1408639110/cekbroklxoki7xajfbut.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DCKT&lt;/span&gt; Contemporary is pleased to present recent drawings by &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SOPHIE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CRUMB&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ALINE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;KOMINSKY&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CRUMB&lt;/span&gt;, the first time mother and daughter have exhibited together.  Their works present observations on present-day womanhood, fluctuating from affable to sardonic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SOPHIE&lt;/span&gt; CRUMB’s watercolor and ink works originate in a purposefully removed place of observation and contemplation: the fashion magazine.  Images of models are rendered in harsh colors and exaggerated angles, with CRUMB’s technique de-idealizing what is being “sold.”  The results are borderline grotesque, pointing up manufactured glamour with dark humor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ALINE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;KOMINSKY&lt;/span&gt;-CRUMB’s works originate in action, participation and performance: the personal makeover.  Endeavoring to understand the desire of some women to remain “forever” younger looking, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;KOMINSKY&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CRUMB&lt;/span&gt; underwent a strip-mall beauty parlor transformation at Hair Magic in North Miami Beach, Florida.  The resulting self-portraits and drawings of people she met there evince a humorous vulnerability and absurdity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SOPHIE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CRUMB&lt;/span&gt; lives and works in France.  Her previous solo exhibition was in 2010 at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DCKT&lt;/span&gt; Contemporary and her work has been included in group shows at Matthew Marks Gallery, Leila Heller Gallery and Paul Morris Gallery.  Sophie Crumb: Evolution of a Crazy Artist, a chronological, lifelong sketchbook anthology, was published in 2010.  &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CRUMB&lt;/span&gt; has been published in Vogue, V, Nylon, Vice, numerous other magazines and has produced her own comics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ALINE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;KOMINSKY&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CRUMB&lt;/span&gt; lives and works in France.  She received her &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BFA&lt;/span&gt; from the University of Arizona (Tucson) in 1971.  Previous solo exhibitions include Art and Culture Center of Hollywood (FL), Museum of Comic and Cartoon Art (NY) and Adam Baumgold Gallery.  Drawn Together: The Collected Works of R. and A. Crumb was published in 2012.  &lt;span class="caps"&gt;KOMINSKY&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CRUMB&lt;/span&gt; has been published in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ARTFORUM&lt;/span&gt;, The New York Times, The New Yorker, Time Out New York, numerous other magazines and has produced her own comics since the early 1970s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exhibition will be on view at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DCKT&lt;/span&gt; Contemporary, 21 Orchard Street (between Canal &amp;amp; Hester).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hours are Wednesday through Sunday, noon &amp;#8211; 6pm.&lt;/p&gt;
